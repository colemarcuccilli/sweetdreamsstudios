- Full Production ($45/hour with optional beat licensing)

**Booking Flow:**
1. Service selection with dynamic pricing
2. Calendar interface with availability checking
3. Stripe payment integration
4. Admin approval workflow
5. Deposit capture and final payment processing

### 3. Payment Integration
**Stripe Implementation:**

## Database Structure (Firestore)
### Collections:
1. **`users`** - User profiles with admin flags
2. **`bookings`** - Booking records with payment tracking
3. **`services`** - Service definitions and pricing
4. **`pricingRules`** - Dynamic pricing configurations

### Security Rules:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have read access to all user data
- Booking creation restricted to authenticated users
- Admin-only operations for booking status updates

## Recent Git History (as of 2025-07-05)
- `7ce9dfe4` - Fix Firebase authentication and implement service-first booking flow
- `417a10c8` - Merge branch 'main' 
- `67446da6` - Update before claude code
- `a6a06095` - Trying to fix stripe setup
- `c440759e` - Major google cloud issues. Cannot get a submitted booking request where testing stripe would request deposit

## Known Issues & Critical Notes

### **CRITICAL - DO NOT BREAK EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY**
- **Service-First Booking Flow**: Recently implemented and working - DO NOT MODIFY unless explicitly asked
- **Firebase Authentication**: Recently fixed - DO NOT TOUCH unless issues arise
- **Admin Dashboard**: Fully functional with booking management, payment controls, and user management
- **Stripe Integration**: Has known configuration issues but payment flow is implemented

### **Current Issues (from git history):**
1. **Stripe Integration Issues** - Previous setup encountered configuration problems
2. **Google Cloud Issues** - Major issues preventing booking submissions and deposit requests  
3. **Mixed Commit History** - Some merge conflicts in admin dashboard code

### **Incomplete/Placeholder Features:**
1. **Data Connect Schema** - GraphQL schema is commented out/placeholder
2. **Navigation Links** - Some nav items point to non-existent pages (/studio, /videography, /branding, /contact)
3. **Portfolio Content** - Portfolio section structure exists but content is placeholder
4. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Some components may need mobile optimization refinement

### **Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```

## Development Guidelines & Rules

### **ABSOLUTE RULES:**
1. **DO NOT BREAK EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY** - If something works, don't change it unless explicitly asked
2. **USER IS FINAL DECISION MAKER** - Always get approval before major changes
3. **PRESERVE EXISTING PATTERNS** - Follow established code conventions and architecture
4. **TEST THOROUGHLY** - Especially authentication and payment flows
5. **DOCUMENT CHANGES** - Update this file after each session

### **Code Patterns to Follow:**
- **Component-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Custom hooks** for authentication and data fetching  
- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Modular service definitions** for booking system
- **React Context** for authentication state
- **Real-time subscriptions** via Firestore listeners
- **Framer Motion** for component-level animations
- **GSAP with ScrollTrigger** for complex scroll-based sequences
