### Session 3 (2025-07-16) - STRIPE INTEGRATION DEEP DIVE - IN PROGRESS
- **Start Time**: Session initiated  
- **Initial State**: Firebase API key issues preventing build, Stripe payment flow completely broken
- **Primary Goal**: Fix Stripe payment authorization for booking system

#### **Issues Encountered & Solutions Attempted:**

##### 1. **Frontend Firebase Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: `auth/invalid-api-key` errors during Next.js prerendering and runtime
- **Root Cause**: Environment variables not properly configured in .env.local
- **Solution**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Recreated .env.local file with UTF-8 encoding (was UTF-16)
- **Impact**: Fixed frontend authentication and build process

##### 2. **Stripe Payment Flow - PERMISSION_DENIED Error**
- **Problem**: Cloud Function `submitBookingRequestWithPaymentAuth` consistently fails with `7 PERMISSION_DENIED: Missing or insufficient permissions`
- **Error Location**: Firestore operations in Cloud Functions (reading customers collection, writing booking_requests)

#### **Systematic Debugging Attempts:**

##### **Authentication Verification**
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: User authentication working properly (test function `testAuth` passes)
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: User UID and email retrieved correctly: `ACz9KDS4HYRmjBniGRi2tlRfn5G2`, `cole@marcuccilli.com`

##### **Service Type Mapping Issues**
- **Problem**: Service data structure mismatch between frontend and Cloud Function
- **Frontend**: Services have `id`, `name`, no `serviceType` field
- **Cloud Function**: Expected `pricingRules` collection lookup
- ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: Implemented hardcoded pricing logic to bypass Firestore service reads

##### **Firestore Security Rules**
- **Initial Rules**: Had `allow read, write: if request.auth == null` for Cloud Functions
- **Updated Rules**: Made ultra-permissive (`allow read, write: if true`) for debugging
- **Result**: ‚ùå **NO CHANGE** - Still getting PERMISSION_DENIED

##### **IAM & Service Accounts Deep Investigation**
- **Discovery**: Two different service accounts involved:
  - `276398858109-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com` (Compute Engine default)
  - `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@sweetdreamsstudios-7c965.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Firebase Admin SDK)

- **IAM Analysis**: 
  - ‚úÖ Compute service account has `roles/datastore.user`
  - ‚ùå Firebase Admin SDK service account initially missing `roles/datastore.user`
  - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Added `roles/datastore.user` to Firebase Admin SDK service account

##### **Cloud Function Initialization**
- **Multiple Attempts**:
  1. Basic `admin.initializeApp()` 
  2. Explicit project ID specification
  3. Simplified Admin SDK initialization
  4. Added proper project ID back with comment about service account usage

#### **What We've Learned:**

##### **About the Architecture**
- Cloud Functions should use Firebase Admin SDK service account, not compute service account
- Firestore security rules apply even to Admin SDK operations in certain contexts
- Environment variable handling differs between local development and Cloud Functions deployment

##### **About the Specific Error**
- Error occurs at `document-reference.js:182:36` in Firestore client library
- This suggests the permission issue is at the API level, not security rules level
- The error happens during both read and write operations to Firestore

##### **What Didn't Work**
- ‚ùå Making Firestore rules completely permissive
- ‚ùå Bypassing all Firestore reads by using hardcoded pricing
- ‚ùå Different Admin SDK initialization strategies
- ‚ùå Removing complex service collection queries

##### **What Got Us Closer**
- ‚úÖ Fixed environment variables (resolved frontend auth issues)
- ‚úÖ Confirmed user authentication works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Identified the exact service accounts involved
- ‚úÖ Added proper IAM roles to Firebase Admin SDK service account
- ‚úÖ Simplified pricing logic to remove dependency on service collection

#### **Current Status - Still Blocked**
- **Error Persists**: `7 PERMISSION_DENIED: Missing or insufficient permissions`
- **Location**: Any Firestore operation in Cloud Functions
- **Service Account**: Firebase Admin SDK service account has all necessary roles
- **Rules**: Firestore rules are completely permissive for debugging

#### **Next Steps - Remaining Hypotheses**

##### **1. Service Account Impersonation Issue**
- Cloud Functions may still be trying to use compute service account despite Admin SDK initialization
- **Action Needed**: Verify which service account is actually being used at runtime

##### **2. Project-Level Policy Conflicts**
- Organization-level policies may be overriding IAM permissions
- **Action Needed**: Check for organization constraints that could block service account access

##### **3. Firebase Admin SDK Version/Configuration**
- Outdated firebase-functions package (warning shows during deploy)
- **Action Needed**: Upgrade to latest firebase-functions version

##### **4. Firestore Database Location/Region Mismatch**
- Admin SDK may be connecting to wrong Firestore region
- **Action Needed**: Verify Firestore database location matches Cloud Function region

##### **5. API Enablement Issues**
- Firestore API may not be properly enabled for the specific service account
- **Action Needed**: Verify Cloud Firestore API is enabled and accessible

#### **Immediate Action Plan**
1. **Upgrade Firebase Functions Package**: `npm install --save firebase-functions@latest`
2. **Add Service Account Debugging**: Log which service account is actually being used
3. **Test Minimal Firestore Operation**: Create simplest possible read/write test
4. **Check Organization Policies**: Look for any org-level constraints
5. **Verify API Enablement**: Ensure all necessary APIs are enabled for both service accounts

#### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ Cloud Function can read from Firestore without permission errors
- ‚úÖ Cloud Function can write to Firestore collections (`customers`, `booking_requests`)
- ‚úÖ Stripe customer creation and payment intent creation work
- ‚úÖ End-to-end booking flow completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard shows created booking requests

#### **Lessons for Future Sessions**
- Always verify exact service account being used in Cloud Functions
- IAM policies can be complex with multiple service accounts involved
- Environment variable encoding issues can cause subtle problems
- Firestore permission debugging requires systematic elimination of variables
- Service account permissions may take time to propagate

## Future Development Priorities
1. **Complete Stripe Integration** - Resolve configuration issues and test payment flow
2. **Implement Missing Pages** - Build out studio, videography, branding, and contact pages
3. **Populate Portfolio** - Add real project content and media
4. **Mobile Optimization** - Ensure responsive design across all components
5. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize video loading and implement proper caching
6. **Testing Strategy** - Add comprehensive test coverage for booking and payment flows
7. **SEO Implementation** - Add metadata and structured data for better search visibility
