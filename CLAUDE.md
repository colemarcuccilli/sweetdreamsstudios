### Session 3 (2025-07-16) - STRIPE INTEGRATION DEEP DIVE - IN PROGRESS
- **Start Time**: Session initiated  
- **Initial State**: Firebase API key issues preventing build, Stripe payment flow completely broken
- **Primary Goal**: Fix Stripe payment authorization for booking system

#### **Issues Encountered & Solutions Attempted:**

##### 1. **Frontend Firebase Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: `auth/invalid-api-key` errors during Next.js prerendering and runtime
- **Root Cause**: Environment variables not properly configured in .env.local
- **Solution**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Recreated .env.local file with UTF-8 encoding (was UTF-16)
- **Impact**: Fixed frontend authentication and build process

##### 2. **Stripe Payment Flow - PERMISSION_DENIED Error**
- **Problem**: Cloud Function `submitBookingRequestWithPaymentAuth` consistently fails with `7 PERMISSION_DENIED: Missing or insufficient permissions`
- **Error Location**: Firestore operations in Cloud Functions (reading customers collection, writing booking_requests)

#### **Systematic Debugging Attempts:**

##### **Authentication Verification**
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: User authentication working properly (test function `testAuth` passes)
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: User UID and email retrieved correctly: `ACz9KDS4HYRmjBniGRi2tlRfn5G2`, `cole@marcuccilli.com`

##### **Service Type Mapping Issues**
- **Problem**: Service data structure mismatch between frontend and Cloud Function
- **Frontend**: Services have `id`, `name`, no `serviceType` field
- **Cloud Function**: Expected `pricingRules` collection lookup
- ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: Implemented hardcoded pricing logic to bypass Firestore service reads

##### **Firestore Security Rules**
- **Initial Rules**: Had `allow read, write: if request.auth == null` for Cloud Functions
- **Updated Rules**: Made ultra-permissive (`allow read, write: if true`) for debugging
- **Result**: ‚ùå **NO CHANGE** - Still getting PERMISSION_DENIED

##### **IAM & Service Accounts Deep Investigation**
- **Discovery**: Two different service accounts involved:
  - `276398858109-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com` (Compute Engine default)
  - `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@sweetdreamsstudios-7c965.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Firebase Admin SDK)

- **IAM Analysis**: 
  - ‚úÖ Compute service account has `roles/datastore.user`
  - ‚ùå Firebase Admin SDK service account initially missing `roles/datastore.user`
  - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Added `roles/datastore.user` to Firebase Admin SDK service account

##### **Cloud Function Initialization**
- **Multiple Attempts**:
  1. Basic `admin.initializeApp()` 
  2. Explicit project ID specification
  3. Simplified Admin SDK initialization
  4. Added proper project ID back with comment about service account usage

#### **What We've Learned:**

##### **About the Architecture**
- Cloud Functions should use Firebase Admin SDK service account, not compute service account
- Firestore security rules apply even to Admin SDK operations in certain contexts
- Environment variable handling differs between local development and Cloud Functions deployment

##### **About the Specific Error**
- Error occurs at `document-reference.js:182:36` in Firestore client library
- This suggests the permission issue is at the API level, not security rules level
- The error happens during both read and write operations to Firestore

##### **What Didn't Work**
- ‚ùå Making Firestore rules completely permissive
- ‚ùå Bypassing all Firestore reads by using hardcoded pricing
- ‚ùå Different Admin SDK initialization strategies
- ‚ùå Removing complex service collection queries

##### **What Got Us Closer**
- ‚úÖ Fixed environment variables (resolved frontend auth issues)
- ‚úÖ Confirmed user authentication works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Identified the exact service accounts involved
- ‚úÖ Added proper IAM roles to Firebase Admin SDK service account
- ‚úÖ Simplified pricing logic to remove dependency on service collection

#### **BREAKTHROUGH: Node.js Version Fix Resolved PERMISSION_DENIED**
- **MAJOR SUCCESS**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Upgrading Node.js version from v18.19.1 to v22.13.1 and reinstalling Firebase CLI completely eliminated the PERMISSION_DENIED error
- **Root Cause**: Firebase CLI v14.10.1 was internally using Node v18, which had compatibility issues with Firebase Admin SDK authentication
- **Solution Steps**:
  1. Verified Node.js v22.13.1 was installed: `node --version`
  2. Uninstalled Firebase CLI: `npm uninstall -g firebase-tools`
  3. Reinstalled Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools@latest`
  4. This resolved ALL Firestore permission issues immediately

#### **New Challenge: Stripe Configuration Issues**
After resolving the core permission problem, we encountered Stripe-specific configuration errors:

##### **Error**: PaymentIntent Redirect Configuration
- **Problem**: `This PaymentIntent is configured to accept payment methods enabled in your Dashboard. Because some of these payment methods might redirect your customer off of your page, you must provide a 'return_url'`
- **Root Cause**: Stripe dashboard has payment methods enabled that require redirects (like certain bank transfers, BNPL methods)
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  1. ‚ùå **FAILED**: Added `automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true, allow_redirects: 'never' }` - Conflicted with explicit `payment_method` parameter
  2. ‚ùå **FAILED**: Replaced with `payment_method_types: ['card']` - Still getting same error after deployment
  3. **ISSUE**: Multiple deployments show "Successful update operation" but error persists, suggesting either:
     - Configuration changes not taking effect
     - Caching issues in Cloud Functions
     - Need to modify Stripe Dashboard settings directly

##### **Progress Made**:
- ‚úÖ **Stripe Customer Creation Working**: Webhook events show `customer.created` successfully
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Authentication Working**: User auth consistently passes
- ‚úÖ **Cloud Functions Deployment Working**: Functions deploy without Node version errors
- ‚ùå **PaymentIntent Configuration Blocked**: Cannot proceed past payment authorization step

#### **Current Status - Stripe Configuration Blocked**
- **Core Issue Resolved**: PERMISSION_DENIED completely eliminated 
- **New Blocker**: Stripe PaymentIntent redirect configuration preventing payment authorization
- **Evidence of Progress**: 
  - Customers being created in Stripe (visible in webhook logs)
  - No more Firestore permission errors
  - Cloud Functions running successfully until Stripe PaymentIntent creation

#### **Remaining Hypotheses for Stripe Issue**

##### **1. Stripe Dashboard Payment Method Configuration**
- **Likely Root Cause**: Dashboard has redirect-based payment methods enabled globally
- **Action Needed**: Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Payment Methods and disable redirect-based methods
- **Alternative**: Configure explicit `return_url` parameter in PaymentIntent

##### **2. Cloud Function Deployment Cache**
- **Possible Issue**: Changes to PaymentIntent configuration not taking effect despite successful deployment
- **Action Needed**: Try full functions redeployment or check for caching issues

##### **3. Stripe API Version Compatibility**
- **Possible Issue**: Using Stripe API version `2023-10-16` which may have different requirements
- **Action Needed**: Upgrade to latest Stripe API version or adjust configuration

##### **4. Payment Method Types Configuration**
- **Current Approach**: Using `payment_method_types: ['card']` but may need different configuration
- **Action Needed**: Test without `payment_method_types` or with different parameters

#### **Recommended Next Steps**
1. **Check Stripe Dashboard Settings**: 
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Payment Methods
   - Disable any redirect-based payment methods (BNPL, bank transfers, etc.)
   - Keep only card payments enabled
2. **Alternative: Add return_url Parameter**:
   - Add `return_url: 'http://localhost:3000/booking/success'` to PaymentIntent
3. **Test Different Stripe Configuration**:
   - Remove `payment_method_types` parameter
   - Try without `confirm: true` parameter
4. **Upgrade Stripe API Version**:
   - Update to latest Stripe API version in Cloud Function

#### **Major Lessons Learned**

##### **Critical Discovery: Node.js Version Issues**
- **Most Important**: Node.js version compatibility can cause Firebase permission errors that appear to be IAM/service account issues
- **Always Check**: When getting PERMISSION_DENIED errors, verify Node.js and Firebase CLI versions first
- **Solution**: Keep Node.js ‚â•20.0.0 and reinstall Firebase CLI after Node upgrades

##### **Debugging Methodology That Worked**
- ‚úÖ Systematic service account analysis led to correct discovery
- ‚úÖ IAM policy review revealed correct service accounts and roles
- ‚úÖ Environment variable troubleshooting (UTF-16 encoding issue)
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step permission elimination approach

##### **What Didn't Help (But Were Logical Steps)**
- ‚ùå Making Firestore rules ultra-permissive
- ‚ùå Adding manual service account configurations  
- ‚ùå Simplifying Cloud Function code to bypass Firestore reads
- ‚ùå Multiple different Admin SDK initialization approaches

##### **Stripe Integration Complexity**
- Stripe configuration errors can be as blocking as permission issues
- Dashboard settings impact API behavior significantly
- PaymentIntent configuration requires careful parameter combination
- Webhook setup needs local API endpoint (`POST /api/webhook 404` indicates missing endpoint)

#### **Success Criteria Status**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Cloud Function can read from Firestore without permission errors
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Cloud Function can write to Firestore collections 
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Stripe customer creation works
- ‚ùå **BLOCKED**: Stripe payment intent creation (configuration issue)
- ‚ùå **PENDING**: End-to-end booking flow completion
- ‚ùå **PENDING**: Admin dashboard booking verification

#### **For Future Development Sessions**
- **Start Here**: The Node.js version fix was the breakthrough - this eliminated the core blocking issue
- **Next Focus**: Stripe PaymentIntent configuration - either Dashboard settings or API parameters
- **Tools Working**: Firebase Admin SDK, authentication, Firestore operations all functional
- **Ready for Testing**: Once Stripe configuration resolved, full payment flow should work
- **Documentation**: Update firebase-functions package (shows outdated warning on every deploy)

## Future Development Priorities
1. **Complete Stripe Integration** - Resolve configuration issues and test payment flow
2. **Implement Missing Pages** - Build out studio, videography, branding, and contact pages
3. **Populate Portfolio** - Add real project content and media
4. **Mobile Optimization** - Ensure responsive design across all components
5. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize video loading and implement proper caching
6. **Testing Strategy** - Add comprehensive test coverage for booking and payment flows
7. **SEO Implementation** - Add metadata and structured data for better search visibility
